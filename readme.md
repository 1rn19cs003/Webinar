  make sure that you have noted down your username and passowrd aswe are going to use it in database.config file

A best alternative of MySQL workbench is using the XAMPP Sever which is easy and make your database get connected easily
****
Inside src folder I have made the [XAMPP](./src/XAMPP/) folder which has te template to connect with XAMPP and Node.js. And we have the same procedure so start and run this.

Once you get conncted with MYSQL Workbech 
enter the username and password in the database config file and database name as well. \
I have made the CRUD(create ,Read Update and Delete )API of Products so you can refer those API to make the changes 


How to start the server 
1) Open your vsCode terminal and type the "npm install" -- It'll install all your required packages inside the  node_modules folder 
2) Once you install the packages type "npm start" and hit enter it'll start your backend server and then you are ready to go .
